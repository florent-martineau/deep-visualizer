### Pre-commit hook

A pre-commit hook enables you to perform some tasks before committing, e.g. running a linter. More information [here](https://pre-commit.com/).

In order to install the pre-commit hook:

1. Start a devbox shell at the root of the repo: `devbox shell`
1. Starting the shell will install the pre-commit hook automatically

Now, everytime you commit some tasks will run, catching bugs even before it reaches the CI!
